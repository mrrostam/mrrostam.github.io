<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="http://cel.mech.ubc.ca/">Control Engineering Laboratory</a> at the University of British Columbia. Broadly speaking, I am interested in developing advanced control algorithms to improve the performance of mechatronic systems. More specifically, my research interests include <b>control theory (adaptive, robust, nonlinear, optimal), model predictive control and optimization, time-series forecasting, and data-driven models</b>. I am currently working on a novel control system combining the model predictive control scheme with a machine learning technique called the Gaussian process. The proposed control system is able to adaptively deal with quasi-periodic unknown disturbances such as energy demand in renewable energy systems.
<br><br>
From an engineering perspective, I call myself an embedded software developer. My areas of expertise include <b>programming for Bare-Metal, RTOS, and Linux systems; working with different types of sensors; and establishing a network between components</b>.

Here's what I've done so far
======

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
